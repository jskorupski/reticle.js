reticle.js
==========

A bookmarklet that will overlay a full-page crosshair/reticle (that follows your mouse pointer) on whatever page you are on. This is useful for precisely aligning content on HTMLpages as you are designing and editing them. 

After activating the reticle, move your mouse around to position it, and press the `f` or `F` key to freeze or unfreeze the reticle so you can edit the page elements using the reticle as a fixed alignment guide.

Un-minified source code is in `reticle.js`, Bookmarklet HTML page with minified source code is in `index.html`
